Steps:
 1) Save the files to create the word lists in "Words".
 2) Put those filenames in the appropriate place in "WordListUpdater.py" to
      create the word list that you need.
 3) Import "DictionaryMaker.py" as "dm" in a python command line and run the
      following line of code:
    
    >>> dm.text_data_add(filename)
    
      where "filename" is replaced by the name of the file.
 4) Change the name of the file to "UpdatedDic_lexYYYY.txt", where "lexYYYY" is 
      replaced by the name and year of the lexicon you plan to use.
 5) Once all lexica are created, then you can start making the databases.
 6) In python, import "Database0Lexicon.py" as d0 and type the following lines of
      code:
    
    >>> d0.lex_table(lexYYYY)
    >>> d0.lex_db(lexYYYY)
